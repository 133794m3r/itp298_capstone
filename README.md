# ITP-298 Capstone Project "Dangling Pointers"


# This repo is now dead.
I'm done with this repo and the lack of work of my partner. Information below is from the original message of the project.

I'll be making a new repo and writing my own item classes and going about it on there as this repo is done.


# Who did what.

This is a simple console-based RPG by [@NathanielMullins](https://github.com/NathanielMullins) who only did the Item class and procrstinated the entire time. So I'm done with it. [@133794m3r](https://github.com/133794m3r) Who did almost all of the work and is thus restarting on his own.

## About
This project is the capstone for ITP-298. Nathaniel and I discussed via email about what project to do and settled on a text-based RPG wrote in C++. 

It was designed to mimic a real-world project as much as possible through the planning and implementation phases. We utilized a Kanban board, Issues, Milestones to help keep everything on task.
